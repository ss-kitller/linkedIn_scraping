# linkedIn_scraping

Students often ask the following question:
What certifications are worthy and I should get, so I can get a good internship?

Well in this project, I tried to answer this frequently asked question.
I scraped LinkedIn to search and collect data related to the certifications that the employers of a company have.
The user of my program can choose whatever company he wants and get a table of certifications with the number of occurences of this certification.


#### What I've learned:
  - Working with Python and using libraries such: Selenium, webdriver, BeautifulSoup, requests.
  - Navigating the page, clicking on elements, filling 'username / password' fields, changing pages dynamically
  - Problem Solving and handling probable errors related to scraping.
  - LinkedIn strict laws about scraping :)
